'''Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the area of the
rectangle is greater than its perimeter. For example, the area of the rectangle with length = 5
and breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter.'''


length = float(input("Enter length: "))
breadth = float(input("Enter breadth: "))
area = length * breadth
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
if area > perimeter:
    print("Area is greater than perimeter")
else:
    print("Perimeter is greater than or equal to area")
