'''An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate premium.
• If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in
a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot
exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
• If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female then the premium is
Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh.
• If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a
village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed Rs.
10,000.
• In all other cases the person is not insured.
Write a program to output whether the person should be insured or not, his/her premium rate and
maximum amount for which he/she can be insured.'''
