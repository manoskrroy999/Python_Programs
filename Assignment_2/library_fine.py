'''A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days the fine is 50 paise, for
6-10 days fine is one rupee and above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30
days your membership will be cancelled. Write a program to accept the number of days the
member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.'''
