'''Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the
triangle are entered through the keyboard. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles
is equal to 180 degrees'''


angle1 = int(input("Enter angle 1: "))
angle2 = int(input("Enter angle 2: "))
angle3 = int(input("Enter angle 3: "))
if angle1 + angle2 + angle3 == 180:
    print("Triangle is valid")
else:
    print("Triangle is not valid")
